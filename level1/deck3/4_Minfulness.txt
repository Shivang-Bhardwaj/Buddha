1. Mindfulness of Body:
  complete awareness of all the activities of the body as they occur (kāyānupassanā).
  eg: mindfulness exercise can focus on breathing ,
        Buddhism nuns and monks have practiced martial arts as a way of bringing meditative focus into movement,
        day-to-day activities can be used as "body practice."
2. Mindfulness of Feelings:
   complete awareness of feelings(both bodily sensations & emotions) as they occur (vedanānupassanā).
   It is practiced by observing these sensations without reacting to them.
3. Mindfulness of Mind:
  complete awareness of all activities of the mind as they occur(cittānupassanā) --> continuously monitor the thoughts going on in mind.
  We learn to observe our mental states dispassionately, without judgment or opinion.
4. Mindfulness of Dharma / mindfulness of mental object:
  According to Buddhist teachings, mental objects refer to the objects of the mind, which are perceived through the six sense organs.
  Mind objects in Buddhism include:
  4.1 Feelings (vedana)
  4.2 Perceptions (sanna)
  4.3 Mental formations (sankhara; emotions & thoughts)
  4.4 Consciousness itself
  4.5 Insight knowledges/laws of nature
  all phenomena, material and immaterial, are considered to be mental objects.The Five Hindrances are mental objects.
  all of the things around us exist for us as mental objects. They are what they are because that's how we recognize them.
