saṃsāra / "cyclic existence" /  "cycle of existence":
1. It is the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death.
2. Sentient beings take rebirth within the "six realms of existence" according to its actions.
    These 6 realms are:
      i. Hell beings Realm -> lower realm
     ii. Hungry Ghosts Realm -> lower realm
     iii. Animal Realm -> lower realm
     iv. Human Realm -> higher realm
      v. Demi-Gods Realm -> higher realm
     vi. God Realm -> higher realm



#####Body and mind under the influence of kleshas and karma####
Samsara is not a place or external environment.
but rather samsara is our own body and mind under the influence of kleshas (disturbing emotions) and karma.

It can refer to our process of circling in the six realms, taking one body and mind after another body and mind-body and mind of a god, 
body and mind of a hell being, etc.



####Characteristics of samsara####
1. Samsara is characterized by dukkha.
2. Samsara is characterized by impermanence.
3. No evident beginning:
    All beings have been suffering in samsara for an unimaginable period of time and will continue to do so until they attain liberation.
4. Habitual, repetitive pattern:
    The pattern is that each new arising, or "birth" if you like, is experienced as unfulfilling.
    They continue to wander in samsara without knowing the root cause.



####Cause####
Root cause of samsara is ignorance (avidya).

Cause for our rebirth in samsara are the kleshas (disturbing emotions) that lead to the creation of karma.
If we can overcome our kleshas, then we will no longer generate the karma that leads to rebirth in the six realms.
