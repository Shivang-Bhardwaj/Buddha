The Buddhist Wheel of Life / wheel of cyclic existence/ Bhavacakra:
It is a pictorial representation of cyclic existence (samsara).



#### First Layer: the three poisons ####
At the center of Wheel of Life are a cock(sometimes a bird), a snake, and a pig.
Pig represent ignorance bcoz it is most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth.
Snake represent anger bcoz it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch.
Bird represent attachment/clinging becoz it is very attached to its partner.

The snake and bird are shown as coming out of the mouth of the pig, indicating that anger and attachment arise from ignorance.
Sometimes, the snake and bird are shown grasping the tail of the pig, representing they in turn promote greater ignorance.

These are the forces that keep the Wheel of Life turning.
Under the influence of the three poisons, beings create karma, as shown in the next layer.



#### Second Layer: Karma ####
The circle outside the center (which is sometimes missing in depictions of the Wheel) is called the Sidpa Bardo.
It is also sometimes called "the White Path and the Dark Path".
The second layer of the wheel shows two-half circles:
1. One half-circle (usually light) shows contented(संतुष्ट) people moving upwards to higher realms of Devas, Gods and Humans.
2. The other half-circle (usually dark) shows people in a miserable state being led downwards to lower realms.

This image represent karma.
The light half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of positive actions.
The dark half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of negative actions.

Propelled by their karma, beings take rebirth in the six realms of samsara, as shown in the next layer.



#### Third Layer: the six realms of samsara ####
1. The three higher realms are shown in the top half of the circle.
    The god realm is shown in the top middle and the human realm and demi-god realms are on either side of the god realm.
2. The three lower realms are shown in the bottom half of the circle
    The hell realm is shown in the bottom middle, with the animal realm and hungry ghost realm on either side of the hell realm.
Sometimes, the wheel is represented as only having five realms because the God realm and the Demi-god realm are combined into a single realm.
Sometimes, there is a buddha or bodhisattva depicted within each realm, trying to help sentient beings find their way to nirvana.



#### Outer Rim: the 12 links of dependent  origination ####
The three inner layers of the wheel show that the three poisons lead to karma, which leads to the suffering of the six realms.
The twelve links of the outer rim show how this happens.



#### The figure holding the wheel: impermanence ####
The creature holding the Wheel of Life in his hooves(खुरों) is Yama, the Lord of the Hell Realm.
In spite of his appearance, Yama is not evil. He is a wrathful(क्रोधी) dharmapala(protector of dharma).

He represents the impermanance.
The entire process of cyclic existence (samsara) is transient; or everything within this wheel is constantly changing.



#### The Buddha pointing to the moon: the hope for liberation ####
In the upper right-hand corner of the Wheel of Life, the Buddha appears.
Often this Buddha is shown pointing to the moon (representing that there is a path to liberation).
The moon itself represent nirvana.
Sometimes, this Buddha stands with his hands raised, as if in blessing.



#### Liberation ####
In the upper left-hand corner of the Wheel of Life is a temple with a seated Buddha.
A stream of beings rise from the Human Realms toward the temple, which represents Nirvana.

Sometimes the upper left-hand figure is a Nirmanakaya Buddha, representing bliss.
Sometimes the artist paints a moon, which symbolizes liberation(nirvana).
Some drawings may show an image of a "pure land" to indicate liberation, rather than a moon.
