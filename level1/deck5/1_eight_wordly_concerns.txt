Eight worldly concerns / eight worldly dharmas:
These are the four pairs of attachments and aversions(घृणा).These are:
1. Gain and Loss
2. Pleasure and Pain
3. Praise and Blame
4. Fame and Disgrace
These worldly concerns generally motivate the actions of ordinary beings.
Preoccupation with these worldly concerns is said to be an obstacle to genuine spiritual practice. 
Even the virtuous(पुण्य) actions bear ordinary fruits if your intention is degraded or based on the eight worldly concerns.


Hoping for positive circumstances:
1. Hope for pleasure (physical comfort and mental happiness)
2. Hope for gain (material wealth and prosperity)
3. Hope for praise (Seeking direct recognition and approval)
4. Hope for a good reputation or fame (Wanting to be well-regarded in society)

Fearing the negative circumstances:
5. Fear of pain (physical and mental suffering)
6. Fear of loss (worrying about losing material wealth and prosperity)
7. Fear of criticism (being afraid of hearing negative feedback directly)
8. Fear of having a bad reputation or disgrace (in one’s society)


We think: To attain happiness, we have to acquire gain, pleasure, praise, fame
and to avoid suffering, we have to run from loss, pain, criticism, disgrace.
But, All these are impermanent and perishable.

It is not bad to buy a car, enjoy a fine meal, to be praised for one's work, or be respected by others.
It means that we should not look for them too much. (we should not be obsessed or attached too much).
   and we should not care too much whether people are praising us or putting us down.
It also means that we should be able to handle losses, pain, criticism, disgrace when they occur 
   and not be thrown into a deep state of depression or despair.

When he become true practitioner, Attachments(gain, pleasure, praise, fame) doesn't disturb his mind
and he isn't repelled by aversions(loss, pain, criticism, disgrace).
