Tanha -> means "thirst"
Other names: Trishna, Craving, Desire



#### Types ####
1. Kama-tanha (sense-craving):
  This is craving for sensual pleasures   or  craving for sense objects which provide pleasant feeling.

2. Bhava-tanha (craving for "becoming" or "existence"):
  This is craving for a fixed identity or existence.
  eg: seeking of certain identity, personality, title
     desire for certain type of rebirth eternally, 
     craving for life, etc
  This type of craving is driven by wrong view of "permanance". (not accepting life’s impermanence)

3. Vibhava-tanha (craving for "no becoming" or "non-existence" or "extermination"):
  This is craving not to experience unpleasant things(unpleasant people or situations) in the current or future life.
  eg: desire to suicide
  This type of craving is driven by wrong view that there is no rebirth.



#### Qualities of Tanha ####
1. Non-deliberate (गैर-जानबूझकर) / Reflexive:
    Craving automatically happens.

2. Bipolar:
    On the one hand is the desire to have something, to possess it, to experience it, to pull it in, to own it.
    On the other hand is the desire to avoid something, to keep it away, reject it, destroy it, and separate it from oneself.
    It has two poles: desire(desire to possess) and aversion(desire to get rid of).

3. Unsatisfactory, unquenchable, addictive:  It means Tanha is a desire that can never be satisfied.
    It is represented in the bhavacakra by a group of people drinking beer or partying.
    The more they drink, the more their craving keeps growing. 



#### Effects ####
The Buddha identified "Tanha" as a principal cause in the arising of dukkha in the world.
eg:from little personal quarrels in families to great wars between nations, 
     all economic, political and social problems,
     conflicts, divisive speech, lies, etc



#### Cessation of ####
According to the four noble truths, cessation of tanha can be obtained by following the Noble Eightfold Path.
Within this path, contemplating the impermanent nature of all things is regarded as a specific antidote to tanha.



#### Contrast to wholesome desire (chanda) ####
Tanha is different from "Chanda".
Wholesome types of desire are traditionally identified as chanda.
eg of chanda:  desire to benefit others, the desire to follow the Buddhist path, desire for liberation, etc.
We should have Chanda (not tanha).



#### Relation to Three Poison ####
1. Ignorance (Avidya/ Moha): mother of Raga and Dvesha & also the mother of tanha.
2. Greed/ passion (Raga): equivalent to kama-tanha and bhava-tanha.
3. Aversion/ Aggression (Dvesha): equivalent to vibhhava-tanha.



#### Within the twelve links ####
Tanha is eighth of the twelve links of dependent origination.
The link of craving is considered one of the crucial links because this is one place where the cycle of the twelve links can be broken

When feeling arises, the craving (tanha) either for more of that feeling or to be free of it arises.
Because of that craving, there is grasping (upadana), which leads in turn to becoming, birth and aging and death.
