Buddha tell to avoid two extremes and to accept the middle way. The middle ways are:
1. Noble eight fold path
2. Dependent origination



Siddhartha Guatama developed the insight that the path to awakening must be a middle way between extreme indulgence in sense-pleasures and extreme austerities(तपस्या).
Buddha presented 'Noble Eightfold Path' as a path to awakening that followed the middle way.



The middle way is also used to refer to the view that rejects the extreme views of eternalism (some things are permanently existing) and nihilism (nothing exists).
The two extreme views with regard to the self (atman) are:
1. there is a permanently existing self or soul that persists after death
2. there is no continuity of the self after death (the self ceases to exist at death)

They are said to be extreme views that should be rejected. 
The middle view asserts that self exists in relation to (or in dependence upon) other causes and conditions. 

Dependent origination teaches that 
1. the existence of phenomena are due to various causes and conditions.
2. When one of these causes changes or disappears, the resulting object or phenomena will also change or disappear.
"Dependent origination" (paticca-samuppada) represents the middle way.



*Eternalism (sassatavāda), this refers to the view that there is "an indestructible and eternal self, whether individual or universal". 
*Annihilationism (ucchedavāda), is the idea that a person is utterly annihilated at death and there is nothing which survives.
