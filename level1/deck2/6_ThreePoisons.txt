three poisons <-> three fires


These are Roots, which are the source of all "evil" and negative mental states  --> Then people take harmful actions. 
They cause most of our problems—and most of the problems in the world.
They are the cause of all evil and misery in the world.


Three poisons badly affect the mind.
Since, physical health is linked to mental states, it also badly affect the physical health(cause diseases).


The three poisons are: 
1. greed (raga, or attachement, desire),  --> product of ignorance
2. hatred (dvesha, or anger), --> product of ignorance
3. delusion (moha, or ignorance)    --> chief root(cause) of all evil and misery in the world.



1. Ignorance(अज्ञान): lack of understanding
   Ignorance doesn't mean lack of common knowledge.
   But It means, lack of understanding of true nature of reality (unclear views of reality).
  1.1 ignorance of "Four Noble Truths"
  1.2 ignorance of "Law of Karma"(ethical cause and effect)
  1.3 ignorance of "Three marks of Existence" 
  
  It seperates us from true reality.

 solution: wisdom (prajna)


2. Hatred:
    Symptoms of hatred: can show up as anger, hostility(शत्रुता), dislike, aversion(घृणा), or ill-will(दुर्भावना); wishing harm or suffering for another person.
    It arises because we don't see the interconnectedness of all things. We see ourselves as separate from everything else.
    solution: lovingkindness (maitri)


3. Greed: 
    It refers to desire or attraction for something or someone we think will gratify us or make us, somehow, better or greater.
    It is also defined as longing for more and more of something, be it sex, money, validation, material objects, or something else entirely.
    When we live in greed, we are forever doomed to a vicious cycle of want that can never be fully rectified.
    eg:  to wear the most stylish clothes so that we will be popular and admired, self-glorification  --> but this makes us more and more isolated.

    solution: generosity (dana)
