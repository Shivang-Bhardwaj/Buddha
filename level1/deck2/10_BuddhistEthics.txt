Why to follow Buddhist Ethics:
1. to build a good character.
2. to avoid harm to oneself and others.
3. help in following(boosting) spiritual training.



1. Śīla(virtue) in Buddhism is one of three sections of the Noble Eightfold Path & is a code of conduct.
    1.1 It refers to moral discipline or purity of conduct(behaviour).
    1.2 It is the first step. It is the foundation for further progress along the Noble eightfold Path.
    1.3 under this category appear three of the eight factors, viz. Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihood.


2.Five precepts:   these are "training rules" or "codes of conduct" that all practicing Buddhists are encouraged to follow.
   Five Precepts are:
   2.1 Refrain(avoid) from taking life, i.e. killing any sentient being.
      2.1.1 Right livelihood includes not trading in weapons or in hunting and butchering animals. 
      2.1.2 one should always have a mind filled with compassion and loving kindness for all beings.
   2.2 Refrain from taking what is not freely given, i.e. theft.
   2.3 Refrain from misuse of the senses or sexual misconduct, i.e. overindulgence in sex or committing sexual offences.
   2.4 Refrain from wrong speech, i.e. lying, gossiping, harsh speech, etc
   2.5 Refrain from intoxicants that cloud the mind, i.e. drugs, alcohol, etc
   
   Living a life in violation of the precepts is believed to lead to rebirth in the lower realms.
                (Action)                                                     (Results)
   Abstention(बचना) from killing                  ->   Kindness and compassion
   Abstention from theft                           ->  Generosity and renunciation
   Abstention from sexual misconduct	    ->   respect for faithfulness
   Abstention from falsehood	                   ->  Being honest and dependable
   Abstention from intoxication	     ->  Mindfulness (awareness)
   
   *kindness : wishing for the welfare and happiness of all living beings.
   *compassion: wish that others be free from suffering.
   *Generosity: attitude of giving
   *renunciation :attitude of dissatisfaction with ordinary, worldly things, coupled with the wish to follow a spiritual path.


3. Kammapatha: refers to the ten wholesome and unwholesome courses (or paths) of action (karma).
    Ten demeritorious(unwholesome) deeds are:
    3.1 Bodily actions:
         - Killing of sentient beings
         - Stealing
         - Wrong conduct in regards to sense pleasures (eg: Sexual Misconduct)
    3.2 Verbal actions:
         - False Speech -> lying
         - Divisive Speech -> use of such speech that would break relation between two people
         - Harsh Speech
         - Idle Chatter  
    3.3 Mental actions:
         - Covetousness(लालच करना): eagerly desirous especially of things(wealth & others) belonging to others
         - Ill-will
         - Wrong View -> not clear understading of Dhamma
    We should abstain from all the above 10 unwholesome actions.

    Ten Bases of Meritorious(सराहनीय) Actions (Ten Punnakiriya-vatthus) / Ten wholesome actions:
    Punna means good deeds. 
    Kiriya means that which ought to be done. 
    Vatthu means that which is the basis for prosperity and welfare.
    So, Punnakiriya-vatthus means: those actions that should definitely be done because they are the basis for prosperity and welfare. They are: 
    3.1 Charity(Dana):
          giving something to needy people with keen volition without any attachement to the things that are being offered.
          giving “the four requisites” to monks; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine.
          Even the poor are encouraged to share, because this brings about greater spiritual wealth.
    3.2 Morality(Sila):
          It means, to do good bodily & verbal actions for developing good moral conduct.
    3.3 Meditation (Bhavana):
          Everyone should practice tranquility meditation (Samatha Bhavana) as well as insight meditation (Vipassana Bhavana) to gain great merit.
    3.4 Giving due respect to others (Apacayana):
          It means, paying due respect to those who are worthy of respect. eg:
          - Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha
          - Elder People (parents, uncle, aunt, etc) , teachers
          - Those who are making effort to improve themselves. eg: Bhikkus, saints, etc
          - Those who are making effort to improve myself. eg: Parents, Brother, Friend, etc
          - Those who are making effort to improve country , etc.
    3.5 Service & Assistance (Veyyavacca):
          helping others in performing good deeds.
          helping persons worthy of respect.
          eg: helping one’s friends in their affairs,helping the sick and the aged, cleaning monasteries, houses, localities,
                placing water-pots on stands for everyone to drink, and building rest-houses, etc.
    3.6 Sharing merits (Pattidana) :
          It means, sharing one’s merits with others after doing some good deeds.
          We can transfer it to deceased relatives, to deities, or to all sentient beings.
          It is believed that the recipient can often receive this merit, if they rejoice in the meritorious acts of the person transferring.
    3.7 Rejoicing(आनन्दित) in the merits of others: 
          It means, rejoicing in others’ meritorious deeds(and saying “well-done” joyfully and sincerely to other’s good deeds).
    3.8 Teaching the Dhamma (Dhammadesana):
          It means: Expounding(व्याख्या करना), writing, distributing and teaching the discourses preached by the Buddha to others, with proper attention, regardless of gain and fame.
    3.9 Listening to the Dhamma (Dhammassavana): 
          It means, listening with proper attention to the discourses(teachings) preached by the Buddha.
    3.10 Having Right Belief (Ditthijukamma):
          Perceiving, accepting and believing in the ten subjects of right view (Dassavatthuka) means Ditthijukamma.
          Dassavatthuka is a list of ten topics that Buddhists should understand and believe in order to have the right view (ditthijukamma). 
          The ten topics are:
          - Karma and its results
          - The three kinds of karma: wholesome, unwholesome and neutral
          - The four noble truths: suffering, its cause, its cessation and the path
          - The past life, the present life and the future life
          - The existence of mother and father
          - The existence of spontaneously arisen beings (such as devas and hell beings)
          - The existence of the world beyond this one (such as the pure abodes of the anagamis)
          - The existence of enlightened ones (such as buddhas, arahants and bodhisattvas)
          - The existence of the fruits of the path (such as stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning and arahantship)
          - The existence of generosity and gratitude


4. Other topics:
- War:
   Buddha encouraged his followers not to fight in wars and not to sell or trade weapons. Conflict(or even war) begins due to 'Three Poisons'.

- Abortion:
  It is seen as an evil act is because a human rebirth is seen as a precious and unique opportunity to do good deeds and attain liberation.

- Suicide and euthanasia(इच्छामृत्यु):
  Ending one's life to escape present suffering is seen as futile because one will just be reborn again, and again. 
  Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma.
  the quality of one's mind at the time of death is believed to condition one's future rebirth.
  Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so suicide is seen as creating negative karma.
  Dying  in a calm but conscious state, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life.

- Capital punishment / Death penalty:
   Buddha never supported Death Penalty.

- Animals and the environment:
  Buddhism does not see humans as being in a special moral category over animals or as having any kind of God given dominion over them.
  Humans are seen as being more able to make moral choices, and this means that they should protect and be kind to animals who are also suffering beings who are living in samsara.
  humans are the part of nature, not as separate from it.
  We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature.

- Vegetarianism:
   Buddha was against the meat consumption.
   Eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said to be incompatible with the compassion that a Buddhist should strive to cultivate.

- Gender issues:
   Women have the same spiritual capacities as men have.
   gender has no influence on one's spiritual ability.

- Relationships:
   A virtuous person should "worships the six directions" which are parents (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North),
      and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down).

- Sexuality:
  one is to refrain from "sexual misconduct":  rape, molestation(छेड़छाड़) and adultery.
  if sexuality is compassionate and/or consensual and does not contravene(उल्लंघन) vows, 
     then there is no karmic infraction, irrespective of whether it is with same-sex(homosexuality) or with opposite sex.

- Economic ethics:
  Creation of wealth should be done morally in accordance with right livelihood.
  Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things.
  To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them.

  a master should look after servants and employees by:
  1) by assigning them work according to their ability
  2) by supplying them with food and with wages
  3) by taking care them in sickness
  4) by sharing with them any delicacies (व्यंजनों / dishes)
  5) by granting them leave at times
 
  Buddha promotes the building of public works which benefit the community. eg: hospitals, parks, wells, canals, rest houses, etc.
  People should engage in social welfare activities for the good and safety of others.
