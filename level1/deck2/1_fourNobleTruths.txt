the 4 noble truths:
1. There is suffering(dukhha -> unsatisfaction):    World is full of sufferings. Every one is suffering in their own way.
    Buddha said "Where there is change, there is dukkha...". He also said "Joy itself is sorrow".
    The axe of impermanence is always there to fell the tree of joy.

2. There is a cause(origin) of suffering:    There are things in life that cause sufferings(sorrow). ex: wordly desires
    Root cause of 'dukkha' is 'tanha' for the things of world. 'tanha' can never be completely satisfied.
    Man’s craving or taṇhā in whatever way you may look at it, and in whatever form it appears, is man’s attempt to gratify(संतुष्टि) himself.
    Grief and fear are states of mind which can arise only when there is craving.
    Cling to that which is changing is as foolish and painful as to cling to a perpetually moving wheel. Thus craving misleads us.
    My sufferings are due to my actions, and my actions are due to my craving or taṇhā.

3. There is an end to suffering:    It is possible to stop sufferings. 
    If the cause of dukhha (i.e. tanha) is removed, dukkha ceases to exist.

4. Path to the end of suffering: Noble eightfold path



Without the path, the first three Truths would just be a theory. 
The practice of the Eightfold Path brings the dharma into one's life and makes it bloom.

By following the teachings of the Buddha, a Buddhist can ‘blow out’ (like a candle) the Three Poisons:
1.greed
2.hatred
3.ignorance (अज्ञानता)
these three things perpetuate(बनाए रखने ) human suffering.

If you are still confused about the four Truths, take heart; it's not so simple. Fully understanding what the Truths mean takes years.
Thorough understanding of the Four Noble Truths defines enlightenment itself.
