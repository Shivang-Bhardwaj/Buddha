Its root word, dham, means "to uphold(बनाए रखने के लिए)" or "to support".
So, Dharma truely means to uphold the "natural orders of the universe".
      (to understand "laws of nature" + to live with them + to uphold them) => Dharma
It is the duty of humans to follow "Dharma". Hence, Dharma also means 'duties' to uphold 'Laws of nature'.

Dharma in Hinduism:
Dharma has a vast range of meanings in Hinduism, depending on the the context.
1. Dharma => natural universal laws. The laws that are followed everywhere in nature, in universe.   eg:  gravity, death, aging, etc.
    It is thought to be our ultimate aim in life to realize the dharma or understand the ways of the universe.
    Dharma is like a cosmic norm and if one goes against the norm, it can result in bad karma. So, Dharma affects the karma.
2. Dharma includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living".
