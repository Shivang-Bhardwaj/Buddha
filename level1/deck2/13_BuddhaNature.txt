Buddha-nature  is the fundamental nature of all beings.


So,What is Buddha-nature?
1. Buddha-nature is "the capacity or potential to attain enlightment and salvation".
2. Everyone has buddha-nature.
3. The only difference between ordinary sentient beings and the buddhas is that a buddha recognizes this nature and ordinary beings have not.
4. The goal of Buddhist practice is to peel away the veils(पर्दा) that prevent us from seeing our true nature, and allow our buddha nature to shine forth.
