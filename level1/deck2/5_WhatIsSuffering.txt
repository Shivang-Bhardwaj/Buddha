The actual meaning of First Noble Truth is "Life does not satisfy".

'dukhha' arises from:

1. tanha / craving:  passionate or powerful clinging to (desire for) something or someone. It is the product of "Ignorance".
    eg: thirst for sensual pleasures, desire for existance or becoming, desire for non-existance or cessation.
