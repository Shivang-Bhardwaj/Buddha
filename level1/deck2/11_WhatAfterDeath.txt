According to the Buddha, beings go through countless births and deaths until they gain enlightenment.


We are reborn due to clinging.
Even when the body dies, the mind continues its clinging and searching.
So, it builds a bridge to another body and takes birth again.


The Buddha taught that the where, when, and how of rebirth is entirely determined by our accumulated karma.
Our actions in this life shape the outcome for next life.


The attitude of the mind at death is very important.
The less fear and aversion we experience at death, and the more focus, calm, and equanimity(धैर्य) we have, the more likely we will be reborn in good circumstances.
Which is why preparing the mind for death through meditation is a core element of Buddhist practice.
