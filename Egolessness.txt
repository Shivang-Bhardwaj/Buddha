Egolessness (Anattaa) or concept of no self:



Buddhism teaches that the cause of all of our suffering is our clinging to what we believe to be our “self.”  
Understanding egolessness or selflessness is the key to healing our personal wounds as well as our relationships, and is an important concept in Buddhist psychology.


ego, self, soul, personality --> all are same

According to buddhism: Actually, There is no self in body.

He who does not understand the egolessness of existence, and who still attached to ego-illusion, such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble Truths of the Buddha in the true light.

According to this view, to provide for the happiness of this illusory self, we not only place our hopes on an impossible goal but also harm ourselves and everyone around us.

But i think having 'ego' is not bad becoz:
ego means your identity.
when we get rid of our ego, we loose our identity.
what happen when 'egolessness' is achieved:  shutdown of feelings, unhealthily low self-esteem & you experience spiritual bypass.
The term 'spiritual bypass' was coined by John Welwood, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist. 
He used it to describe a more general “tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.”

Spiritual bypass happens when you try to erase your ego before you make it functional. This usually leads to reinforcing your psychological issues, instead of resolving them.

So, we should focus on developing 'healthy ego'.
From this perspective, you need a healthy ego not just for your own sake. You need to “upgrade” your identity so that it’s more helpful to you and the rest of the world.
